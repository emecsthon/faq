## FAQ (Finally)

### Which hardware will be available?

You can decide to either use a STM32 Nucleo Board or a FPGA for your project. We will provide you with general eletronic components (resistors, leds, capacitors...) as well as lab equipment (multimeters, solder stations ...). Furthermore, the following sensor kit will be available twice: 

### How can we order hardware?

Each group will get a budget of 50€ to order additional hardware. You should think a bit about your project before the event. We can order from reichelt.com, conrad.com, farnell.com and de.rs-online.com/web/. Make sure your hardware is available and can be delivered in time. Please send us your wishlist until friday if possible.

### I already got some hardware at home which I want to use. Can I bring it?

Sure. But you will need to either use the Nucleo or the FPGA in your project. Also make sure the hardware you bring is disassembled, so no half-finished projects ;)

### Should I bring my Laptop?

Yes, please.

### When does the event start?

We will start at 13:00 24th of May. Meeting point is building 12 5th floor.

### Can I go home during the event?

Of course, you are free to work or rest as you please. :)
