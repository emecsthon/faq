# EMECSthon

Embedded Student Hackathon

## About

Teams of 2 to 4 people implements an Embedded System of any Shape and Form for 48 hours. Each team is provided with two development platforms, required lab equipment, sensors and an additional budget for desired hardware. Also, some catering will be provided. Event starts on May 24th at 13:00, teams are allowed to work on their projects until 13:00 on May 26th, which should be followed by a 5 minute presentation of the developed content. Jury includes a student, a professor and an industry representative

## FAQ

### Which hardware will be available?

You can decide to either use a STM32 Nucleo Board or a FPGA for your project. We will provide you with general eletronic components (resistors, leds, capacitors...), two sets of [sensors](https://www.reichelt.de/arduino-40-in-1-sensor-kit-sensors-and-modules-ard-sensor-kit-2-p159951.html?GROUPID=8244&START=0&OFFSET=16&SID=92XK25ZawQAUAAAC5KkhA45f6fe75137e2419a87a9fc7ce302b13&LANGUAGE=EN&&r=1), as well as lab equipment (multimeters, solder stations ...).
